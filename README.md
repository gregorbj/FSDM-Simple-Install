# FSDM-Simple-Install
This repo contains the Fuzzy System Dynamics Software with all package dependencies included in one zip archive. The purpose is to provide a installation method for computers running the Windows OS that is simpler than the method required to use the FSDM package which requires the user to install a number of R packages in addition to the R language.
