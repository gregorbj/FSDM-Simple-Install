<h2>Calculate updated concept values by applying model relations to a set of
concept values and changes to those values.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>calcRelationEffects</code> updates concept values by applying
relations to a set of concept values and changes to those concept values.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
calcEffects(V_Cn, R_Cn, M)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>V_Cn</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of values in the interval (0, 100]
identifying the relative value of each concept.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>R_Cn</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of values identifying the proportional
change in each value.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>M</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list containing the FSDM model components</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Since most models include cycles, the model calculations must be iterated
until the concept values change very little between iterations or until a
maximum number of iterations has been completed. In each iteration, the
proportional changes to concept values from their starting values are
updated by applying the calcPropChange function to calculate the proportional
change due to the proportional change in each of the anterior concepts
affecting the concept and then adding up the proportional change differences.
This is done for each of the concepts in the model. For example, if a
posterior concept has 2 anterior concepts affecting it and if the change
ratio from one of them is 1.2 (i.e. the posterior concept is 1.2 times its
previous value) and the change ratio from the other is 1.3. Then the sum of
the proportional change differences is 0.5 and the total proportional change
is 1.5.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list having 3 named components. Ratio is the ratio of change of the
'independent' concepts. Values is a numeric vector of the value of concepts
after 'independent' concepts have been incremented. MaxValueChg is a number
identifying the maximum percentage change in the values of concepts between
starting and ending values.
